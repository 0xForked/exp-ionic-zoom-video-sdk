# Complete a fresh build of your Ionic project, fixing any errors that it reports:
ionic build

# Every time you perform a build,  you'll need to copy those changes into your native projects:

# Note: After making updates to the native portion of the code (such as adding a new plugin), use the sync command:
ionic cap sync
